  abstract = {    Modern software systems, like GNU/Linux distributions or Eclipse-based
    development environment, are often deployed by selecting components out of
    large component repositories. Maintaining such software systems by
    performing component upgrades is a complex task, and the users need to have
    an expressive preferences language at their disposal to specify the kind of
    upgrades they are interested in. Recent research has shown that it is
    possible to develop solvers that handle preferences expressed as a
    combination of a few basic criteria used in the MISC competition, ranging
    from the number of new components to the freshness of the final
    configuration. In this work we introduce a set of new criteria that allow
    the users to specify their preferences for solutions with components aligned
    to the same upstream sources, provide an efficient encoding and report on
    the experimental results that prove that optimising these alignment criteria
    is a tractable problem in practice.},
